# OpenTES4Oblivion
The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Open Source Documentation &amp; Tools.

This project aims to create open source tools, documentations on file formats (and maybe even a day an engine) for The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.

The project is inspired by the OpenTESArena, OpenMW and all the open source re-implementation of game engine.  
This project would never have been possible without the work done by the community of the [Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages](https://en.uesp.net/), thanks a lot to them for their work.
